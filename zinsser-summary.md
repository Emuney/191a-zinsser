#Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Evan Munemura

An important objective for written documents is to maintain 
consistent interest from the readers. William Zinsser suggests 
simplifying sentences and avoiding clutter are effective methods 
for concise writing because they minimize superfluous components. 
The reexamination phase shortens sentence length and removes 
redundant preposition, benefitting the overall communication 
quality. Simplifying removes unimportant words that result with 
effective sentences communicating the main themes. Being direct 
gets straight to the point, and sustains the readersâ€™ interest 
by not wasting time. Reexamining and simplifying a paper will 
produce clear and concise communication for easier comprehension 
amongst readers.
